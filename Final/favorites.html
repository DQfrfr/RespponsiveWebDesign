            <h2>YouTube</h2>
            <img src="yt logo.png">
            <p>Youtube has been a website i've loved to use since I was 5 years old. Wether it's<br>
            looking up a tutorial for something I'm doing or just trying to entertain myself<br> Youtube always has always come in clutch

            <hr>
            <h2>Soundcloud</h2>
            <img src="soundcloud.png">
            <p>Soundcloud has been a website I've used since 6th grade. My main usage for it now is<br>
            to listen to unreleased music from some of my favorite artist. This App in my opinion is best used for that purpose

            <h2>Beamng Forums</h2>
            <img src="beamnglogo.png">
            <p>One of my favorite games to play is called Beamng.Drive. Thanks to the devs of this game<br>
            being so responsive, this game is <strong>VERY</strong> moddable. This led the devs to make a forum for any <br>
            questions, troubleshooting or just general discussions players may want to have. My favorite aspect <br>
            of this forum is the mod section. This allows players of the game to upload and share mods they've made. <br>
            That reason alone is enough for this to be one of my favorite sites.

        <summary>Instagram</summary>

            <hr>
            <h2>Instagram</h2>
            <img src="instalogo.png">
            <p>Instagram is one of my favorite sites to communicate with friends. Its just so central i guess<br>
            I've also been using this since 6th grade so it makes sense that it grew on me so much over the years.

        <summary>Twitter</summary>
        <div> 
            <hr>
            <h2>Twitter</h2>
            <img src="twitterlogo.png">
            <p>Twitter will always have a special part in my heart. While we have had some high highs<br>
            we have also had some really low lows. That pushed aside, twitter usually never fails to make <br>
            me laugh. So I think that solidifies it at #5

        <summary>ChatGPT</summary>
        <div>
            <hr>
            <h2>ChatGPT</h2>
            <img src="chatgptlogo.png">
            <p>This is probably the most useful site I have on this list. From helping me with homework assignments<br>
            to actually giving some good advice sometimes I think chatgpt had earned its spot here
            </p>

        <summary>MonkeyType</summary>
        <div>
            <hr>
            <h2>MonkeyType</h2>
            <img src="Monkeytypelogo.png">
            <p>I actually really enjoy typing. I fell in love back in 5th grade when i was introduced to nitrotype. <br>
            I didn't really start monkey type until senior year of high school though. I recently hit my pr of 105 wpm <br>
            so its safe to say I really enjoy using this site.

            <h2>RemoveBG</h2>
            <img src="removebglogo.png">
            <p>Remove.BG is probably one of the most useful and underrated sites out there. And its such a simple one at that<br>
            This site has really helped when it comes to putting together presentaions when all the pictures I want to use happen to have a background
